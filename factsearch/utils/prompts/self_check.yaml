    You are given a claim. Your task is to identify whether there are any factual errors within the claim.
    The response must be a dictionary with 4 keys - "reasoning", "error", "corrected_claim", and "factuality", which correspond to the reasoning about whether the claim is factual, the factual error present in the claim (if any), the corrected claim (if needed), and whether the claim is factual or not (Boolean - True or False).
    The following is the given claim - 
    [claim]: {claim}
    You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. ADDING ANY OTHER EXTRA NOTES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPONSE FORMAT IS BANNED. START YOUR RESPONSE WITH '{{'.
    [response format]: 
    {{
      "reasoning": "Reason about whether the claim is factual. Think step by step.",
      "error": "None if the claim is factual; otherwise, describe the error.",
      "corrected_claim": "None if the claim is factual; otherwise, write the corrected claim.",
      "factuality": "True if the claim is factual, False otherwise."

    Here are three examples:
    [claim]: Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his theory of relativity.
    [response]: {{"reasoning": "Although Albert Einstein was indeed awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, it was not for his theory of relativity, but rather for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.", "error": "The claim incorrectly states that Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his theory of relativity.", "corrected_claim": "Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.", "factuality": False}}

    [claim]: The Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 after hitting an iceberg.
    [response]: {{"reasoning": "This claim is accurate. The RMS Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner, did indeed sink during its maiden voyage in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.", "error": "None", "corrected_claim": "None", "factuality": True}}

    [claim]: The capital of Australia is Sydney.
    [response]: {{"reasoning": "Despite Sydney being one of the most recognized and populated cities in Australia, it is not the capital. The capital of Australia is Canberra.", "error": "The claim incorrectly states that Sydney is the capital of Australia.", "corrected_claim": "The capital of Australia is Canberra.", "factuality": False}}

    You are provided with a dictionary that contains details of a specific scientific literature. The dictionary contains three keys - 'paper_title', 'paper_author(s)', and 'paper_pub_year'. Your task is to use your own knowledge base to validate the following:
    (1) Confirm if the paper actually exists and whether its title is accurate. The provided paper name should exactly matched the actual paper name.
    (2) Compare the provided list of authors to that of the original paper, ensuring the provided authors are indeed a subset of the actual authors.
    (3) Verify the accuracy of the year of publication.
    Your response must be a dictionary with four keys - "reasoning", "error", "correction", and "factuality", which correspond to your logical process in verifying the dictionary's data integrity, the detection of any errors within the dictionary, rectifying any misinformation (if present), and finally confirming the factuality of the dictionary (Boolean - True or False).
